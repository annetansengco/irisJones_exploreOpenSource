# irisJones_exploreOpenSource
This repo is for the girls who code explore open source challenge.

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.

Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesnâ€™t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

My response to the prompt is below:
Making her project open source will allow more testers to access it, but it sounds like she needs a way to actively recruit more user-testers. Maybe she should ask GWC to help her recruit.
